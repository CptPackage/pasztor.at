BDD, TDD, Scrum, Kanban, SAFe, Extreme Programming? There are dozens if not hundreds of methodologies that aim to make
your software development and teamwork more efficient, less error-prone and in better in every aspect. Yet, we hear
so many horror stories about how these things went wrong to one degree or another.

The blame, quite often, falls on the methodology. TDD is too hard or inefficient. Scrum is bulldung. You must have heard
such strong opinions before if you work in the industry. But how can so many methodologies, thought up by smart people,
be wrong that badly?

In my experience these methodologies are at not at fault here. Each of them can be used to great effect, or can
absolutely ruin your experience and send you running back to your old methods to get anything done.

When saying this I can already hear the agile coach saying: *&ldquo;You are doing it wrong. You haven't implemented
it correctly. You need to adapt agile to your organization.&rdquo;*

Yes, they are right, you did not implement it correctly and you haven't adapted it. But what is not answered is *how*.
To me these issues are not a problem of *process*. Thinking back at my professional past, this is exclusively a problem
with *humans*. Or more specifically, the way *humans* have been treated.

Humans have emotions, not just in their private life, but also at work. Emotions such as *pride*. Or *stress*. *Fear*.
*Jealousy*. What I have seen countless times is that a team member or even worse, an external coach or scrum master,
gets put into position and starts telling everyone how this new methodology works and what process people are supposed
to follow.

*Process*. Implicitly, the process implies that people don't know how to do their work, that's why we need to enforce
rules on them. And, don't get me wrong, that may be absolutely true. Heck, if I don't force myself to write tests, for
example, I make painfully obvious and stupid mistakes. This was always true, but what wasn't is the fact that over the
years I learned to accept this as a fact and write tests for my code. The same is also true about my time management
skills, which the whole *agile* thing helps with.

So how do you get people to accept that they are humans and maybe just a little process is not such a bad idea? What 
are the factors the factors that make or break such a project? 

## Personal Pride and Introversion

Engineers are *proud* people. Many of us got into the profession because we wanted to *create* something. Our projects
are our babies, we are emotionally invested in them. If someone compromises our vision of the project, or we feel that
our opinions are being disregarded by some new manager, scrum master, or our boss, our motivation drops and our 
productivity grinds to a halt. If given the choice in such a situation we will happily vote to kill off the whole
new methodology project.

What also doesn't help in this process is that there are a lot of discussions to be had about how things should be done.
A lot of us being *introverts* to some degree or another, having large discussions in meeting rooms with a lot of people
intimidates us. Of course, I would have never admitted to this even a year ago, but it's true. These discussions on
how we should do things in the future are exhausting and are usually won by the person with the strongest opinion.

A good boss, scrum master or agile coach can do a lot to help the individual team members in this situations, making 
their voice heard. However, not like you might think. Imposing some rules on the discussions, such as everyone gets to
talk for five minutes (yet more process) will not alleviate our fears. As much as my colleagues wouldn't think so, I
absolutely *hate* speaking in a group if I'm not a 100% sure about what I'm saying.

I'm much more comfortable discussing my opinions in private over a coffee. Yes, the coffee machine in the office can be
a great project management tool. It is much easier to open up in a one on one conversation, trying to flesh out a 
half-baked idea, find the right words to explain what exactly one means. It will also be easier if the boss/coach/scrum
master brings up the topic in the conversation and the team member in with the idea knows that they don't have to stand
up for themselves and risk being alone in the room. After all, they have the at least one other voice in the room
thinking that their idea is worth listening to.

## The New Boss and Restructuring

One unfortunate situation a team and their leader, scrum master, or other person of influence can get into is when
someone who does not enjoy the trust of the team gets put into a position of power. This may be an external scrum master
or agile coach who is now supposed to tell a team how to structure their work, or a hired team lead. Anyhow, when
a new team member is hired, especially into a leadership position, it takes a while until this new team member gets
their bearings and knows how the team &ldquo;ticks&rdquo;. The team also needs to bond and learn to trust the new
member or leader.

This inevitably causes friction in the team, especially if the new leader starts changing things immediately, which
leads to a loss of efficiency. It can also lead to a feeling of frustration if the team members feel steamrolled by
the new direction. A good leader can somewhat soften the blow by listening to the team a lot in the initial few months.
The listening process will speed up the assimilation into the team, and being accepted as a cooperative team member.
This, of course, is not an option for an agile coach as they are usually hired for a limited amount of time.

An even larger disruption can be caused if not only a single person is changed, but a larger chunk of the company is
reorganized. Such a reorganization, even if the roles are defined in a crystal clear fashion, still cause a disruption
of work, since the people involved need to get their bearings.

Often times a small-scale trial of the new system can provide a positive input for the time when the larger roll-out is
happening later on. For example, say, you roll out TDD (Test Driven Development) across your development teams. If this
is done in such a way that only a single team starts testing in this fashion, inevitably, this team will have a learning
curve and will need to figure out how to do things under the new rule. However, this team, by going through this
learning curve will have the experience to help the other teams later on. They will, hopefully, be the torchbearers that
the new method really works and really increases productivity and quality over time. Or, in contrast, you might discover
issues with the new methodology and this way, the negative impact will be limited to one team instead of tanking the
whole company for a few weeks or months.

Similarly, the roll-out of the new methodology can be limited to a certain bit of the project itself. TDD, for example, 
can be used and experimented with on a very complex part of the codebase. Similarly, an agile methodology can be
limited to a single project, as long as that piece of code or project is allowed the time to go through the speed
impact associated with the learning curve.
